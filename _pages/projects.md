Creating the next-generation Intelligent Automation System (IAS), which could run 24/7 without human intervention, for the Materials Innovation Factory at the University of Liverpool (Cooper Group).

Right now, the system is performing photocatalytic workflow in our lab. More chemistry workflows coming.

IAS is a combination of Robotic Process Automation (Kuka iiwa KMR, ABB YuMi, etc.), Chemistry Equipment (ChemSpeed liquid solid dispensing machine, HPLC, etc. ), IoT technologies, and Artificial Intelligence (Bayesian Optimization, Computer Vision, etc.) which together empower rapid end-to-end process automation and accelerate digital transformation, allowing discovery of useful products such as energy materials, special medicine, etc.

I am working on the automation system (IAS) architecture design, AI algorithm design, software development, IoT design (smart sensor, microcontroller, etc.), robotics programming, etc.
